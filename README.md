## a low-maintancene, low-cost early wildfire detection system
The whole idea behind it was that my team wanted to create a wildfire detection system that you can just setup once and forget about it (not literally, cause taht would be highly irresponsibleðŸ™„). After a lot of burnt papers and other burnt things that i cant mention, we landed on using a linear heat detector cable.
