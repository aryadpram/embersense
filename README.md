# Embersense :fire:
## A Low-Maintenance, Low-Cost Early Wildfire Detection System

Embersense was born from our team's goal of creating a wildfire detection system that requires minimal maintenance—you can set it up once and let it do the work. After plenty of trial and error (and a few things we’d rather not mention going up in flames), we settled on using a linear heat detector cable as the core sensor technology.

## What's Inside

This repository contains everything you need to build the hardware for Embersense. For the front-end and back-end software, you can find the code at the following repositories:  
- [Backend Repository](https://github.com/lutfiandri/embersense-be)  
- [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/lutfiandri/embersense)

To give you a quick visual overview, here’s a banner summarizing the key features and structure of Embersense:
